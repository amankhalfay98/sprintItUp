# sprintItUp
The idea behind the project is to create a combination of game rooms to help old-aged people fight the four most common mental issues which are stress, depression, fear, and aggression. It is an AR game where the character can walk from one room to another. 


We have Implemented the Living Room where the game begins and users will see four doors to choose from. We the player passes through any of the door they would be taken to a different scene.


We have also created the basic structure of all the rooms

Fear Room: The maze Structure is setup and the player initialized, also obstacles created

Depression Room: The Terrain has been created with mountains and different region sculpt, the room has also been textured to get a grass like feels to the ground, the player has been initialized

Agression Room: The room with Different wallpapers has been created along with a window, some tools (hammer, baseball bat). These will be used by the user to break things in future sprints.

Stress Room: The room has been created with a larger window through which the user will be able to see sun and other scenic beauty, this room also contains a cabinate with different fruits for the user.


With the base of all rooms set we will be working on adding audio, video effects, movement control, mini games and much more.... So Please Stay TUNED!!
